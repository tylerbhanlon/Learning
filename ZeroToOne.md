# Zero to One

## Chapter One - The Challenge of the Future

Thiel opens the book with an interesting question he says he raises in interviews:

*What important truth do very few people agree on?*

Thinking about this question as I read, I honestly had no idea how to answer it. My mind immediately jumped
to thinking about less popular beleifs I hold compared to others. The key word that stuck out to me in this
question was *important*. 

He describes the future as the set of all things yet to come, so if radical change falls upon us 
tomorrow, then the future is only one day a way. Thiel thinks a good answer to the above
question should look to the future, instead of referencing the present.

This entire chapter essentially centers upon the importance of the book's namesake, *Zero to One*

0 -> 1 = Vertical Growth
1 -> n = Horizontal Growth

We see plenty of examples of 1 -> n in todays world in the form of globalization.
Look around and you notice that for the amount of technology we have, not many true advancements
have been made outside of the world of computing in the last few decades.

This is due largely in part to most advancements globally focusing on 1 -> n, taking something that
works and making it more readily available or more accessible.

Technology is described as a new way of doing something.

Globalization *without* technology is unsustainable. 

He ends the chapter by stating that his answer to the original question is that many people think that that
the future of the world will be defined by globalization, but the truth is that technology matters more.

A startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future. 

## Chapter 2 - Party like its 1999

This was an interesting chapter, as it spoke on the dot com crash of the early 2000's and 
its overall consequences on entrepeneurial thinking that continue to this day.

With the billions of dollars currently being invested into AI, this chapter seemed ever more current.

Some time is spent talking through the history and the context of the decade leading up to the dot com crash.

The US was in a recession by the mid 1990's, things just overall felt sluggish even in Silicon Valley.
User-friendly browsers weren't even widely available in 1993 with the Mosaic browser.

This evolved into the company Netscape and itss Navigator browser in 1995, which dominated 80% of the browser market
and IPO'd in August '95 without even being profitable. The stock rose from $28 to $174 in 5 months.

Yahoo went public, followed by Amazon, both being valued at hundreds of millions of dollars. Tech companies were booming, stocks
weere tripling and even quadrupling over the course of just a few months.

World events outside of the US (Ruble crisis, East Asian financial crisis) fueled this mania. People were desperate
and misplaced their hopes because it seemed like nothing else in the world seemed to be working. 

During the short lived mania in September 1998 to March 2000 dozens of new startups launched a week, having
big launch parties before even delivering a product. The msot successful companies had to adopt a model where
they lost money as they grew.

"...irrationality was rational given that appending ".com" to your name could double your value overnight"

Thiel speaks a bit on PayPal, and how they knew the bubble would burst, so they needed to raise money before it did.
Their main issue was a small and slowly growing user base. In order to spur their growth, they offered users $10 
to sign up. 

The NASDAQ reached 5,048 in the middle of March 2000 and bottomed out at 1,114 in October 2002.

"Everyone learned to treat the future as fundamentally indefinite, and to dismiss as an extremist anyone with plans 
big enough to be measured in years instead of quarters"

We went back to globalization for the hope for the future. 

From the dot-com burst we have taken away 4 incorrect principles:
1. Make incremental advances
2. Stay lean and flexible
3. Improve on the competition
4. Focus on product, not sales

but Thiel argues that the following are probably more correct:
1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality
2. A bad plan is better than no plan
3. Competetive markets destroy profits
4. Sales matters just as much as product

Theil urges us to question how much of what we know about business is is shapen by mistaken reactions to past mistakes.
